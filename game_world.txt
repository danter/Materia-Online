### Some world Ideas ###

--- Basic ---
The world should be based on the amber series from Roger Zelasny, where you can warp between dimensions that is close to eachother in look, but still differs some from eachother. Weapons and materials should change there basic properties depending on what world you are in, but you also travel arround with a form of crunched space (like in terranigma) where you can store items for different worlds, and also perform alterations on your gear to fit the world you are currently in. See the crunched space as a form of personal home you have.


--- Crunched Space ---
Your crunched space might also be improved by gathering materials for that world, and slowly building it as you see fit, just like in "Dark Cloud" where you gather buildings, accessories and other stuff in the atamillia, and then place them in a world builder. All the materials for that world will be gathered in your own personal world, and depending on what stuff you gather there, new items will become awailable in the real world aswell... see it as a form of syncronising with your own soul to become stronger. Naturally you should be able to invite your friends to your own world, or even battle against other players in your world.
It's mainly a single/duo player world thou, where you have the option of inviting your friends to battle in co-op for improving both your worlds and maybe even linking them togheter, and thats the fundamental way to create combined battle moves, there will be other ways of creating combined battle moves, but this is one of the basic ways.
